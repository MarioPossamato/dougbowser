## Pre-Requisites
[dougbowser](https://github.com/MarioPossamato/DougBowser/archive/master.zip)  
[Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)  
PyQt5: `pip install PyQt5`
PyCrypto: `pip install pycrypto`
NintendoClients: git clone https://github.com/Kinnay/NintendoClients

## Running dougbowser
Open the NintendoClients folder, and copy the `nintendo` folder to the wherever dougbowser is stored on your machine.  
On Windows, as long as .py files open with Python 3.6 by default, you can just double-click the `dougbowser.py` file.
Otherwise, run `C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\python.exe dougbowser.py`
On Linux...  I don't use Linux, so I don't really know for sure if it will work :P but you can try running the following in a terminal:
```
cd ~/dougbowser
chmod a+x dougbowser.py
./dougbowser.py
```
DO NOT USE THIS SCRIPT RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE THE ENCRYPTION IS NOT WORKING CORRECTLY!
